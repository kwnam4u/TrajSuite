# TrajSuite
TrajSuite is a cross-platform Java application that provides a suite of trajectory data-mining and visualisation features all with a nice gui. All functionality in TrajSuite is provided by modules, with the goal that the software is easy to extend, contribute to, and customise.

Currently TrajSuite is built with the following functional modules:
* [Trajectory data loading](https://github.com/lukehb/137-datastructures)
* [Trajectory simplification](https://github.com/lukehb/137-simplification)
* [Trajectory stop/move detection](https://github.com/lukehb/137-stopmove)
* [Trajectory clustering](https://github.com/lukehb/137-clustering)
* [Region-of-interest/Sequential pattern mining](https://github.com/lukehb/137-roi)
